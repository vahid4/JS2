IN React.js a component is a piece of code that represent a part of user interface.
It can be a class component or a functional component.
Class component is a js class that extends React.Component class, while a functional component is a js
function that returns only the React element.

A Purecomponent is a special type of component that is similar to a component, but with additional features,
or optiimizations. When a component is a PureComponent, react will do a shallow comparison of the props
and state before re-rendering the component. That means that if props and state have not changed,
the component will not be re-rendering. This can lead to a performance boost in some cases,
but its not used properly, it can lead to unexpected behaviour.

bottomline, a component is the most basic and most used for building a block in React and
PureComepoint is used when it needs some special optimization. 

Props(properties) is a way for manipulating data and states.
We can send data through props and we can send data to parent through props.
